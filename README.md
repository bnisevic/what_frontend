### Development Env

`docker compose up --build`

This will automatically use:

- docker-compose.yml ‚úÖ (base)
- docker-compose.override.yml ‚úÖ (dev-specific: volume mounts, runserver, hot reload)

üîÅ Hot reload is enabled for Django and React through volume mounting and dev servers.


### Production Env

`docker compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.prod.yml up --build`

This will:
- Use production Dockerfiles for frontend and backend 
- Run gunicorn for Django 
- Build React static assets with npm run build and serve them with npx serve 
- Avoid mounting your local source code
